======================================
Features that WON'T be in v0.3.0
======================================

record_history
-----------------

    Support the `file` keyword parameter? as a setting?
        Can use `log_*` methods, and output is always via print,
        BUT also always to `sys.stdout`. Allow `sys.stderr` at least.

    Support the `override` parameter?
        After all, it can deco classes and it supports decorate_* methods.
        CHECK THIS: does it not support `override`???

    `record_history` does or does not support `set_defaults()`, `reset_defaults()`?

log_calls
-------------

    `file` parameter: allow string pathnames?
        Probably NOT, but think about it.



==============
TESTS
==============

    `record_history` does or does not support `set_defaults()`, `reset_defaults()`?
        Verify/refute
        DOC (What's New) implies that only `log_calls` does:
            * `log_calls` has classmethods to globally set and reset
              default values for settings, program-wide:
        Adjust if need be

    `record_history` with `decorate_*` methods
        They work?
        DOC says they do
